todo: Random forest can be used for classification and regression both. There are both random forest classifiers and regressers. 

*Dataset should be divided into test and train set. The train set generates a fully functional model. 

?What is the main difference between machine learning and deep learning?
* In machine learning, feature extraction and classification are done separately. But in deep learning, these two are done all along. 

?When to use Machine Learning and when to use deep learning?
* If the data set is short go for machine learning and if the data set is huge go for deep learning.
