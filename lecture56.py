?WHAT ARE FEATURES IN MACHINE LEARNING?
*pixel value, brighness value, edges.

todo There are various filters and techniques that can be used to extract features from an 
todo image in the field of computer vision and image processing. Here is a list of commonly used filters for feature extraction:

*   1. Gaussian Filter: A smoothing filter used to reduce noise and blur an image.

*   2. Sobel Filter: An edge detection filter that highlights edges in the image.

*   3. Laplacian Filter: A filter used for edge detection and enhancing details in an image.

*   4. Canny Edge Detector: A multi-stage edge detection algorithm that provides robust edge detection with low false positives.

*   5. Hough Transform: A technique used to detect lines, circles, and other shapes in an image.

*   6. Gabor Filter: A filter used for texture analysis that captures spatial frequency and orientation information.

*   7. Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG): A feature descriptor that captures local gradients and their orientations to describe the shape and appearance of objects.

*   8. Scale-Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT): A feature detection and description algorithm that is robust to scale, rotation, and affine transformations.

*   9. Speeded-Up Robust Features (SURF): A feature detection and description algorithm that is computationally efficient and provides robustness to various image transformations.

*   10. Local Binary Patterns (LBP): A texture descriptor that captures the local structure and patterns in an image.

*   11. Haralick Texture Features: A set of texture features based on co-occurrence matrices that describe the texture properties of an image.

*   12. Color Histogram: A representation of the distribution of colors in an image.

*   13. Entropy Filter
