*Linear Regression Method

*for linear regression we need to calculate the cost function. For this gradient descent algorithm is used. This algorithm finds the 
*actual minimum cost point by small or large step size which is called the LEARNING RATE. By that minimum cost point we draw a line
*which is our model.
